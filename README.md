# DOOM I + II Launcher â€“ MS-DOS Style

Relive the nostalgia of 1993 with this classic DOOM I + II Launcher, designed to emulate the authentic MS-DOS experience.

**System requirements:**<br>
- Windows 10: Requires manual installation of the [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/).
- Windows 11: Comes with the WebView2 Runtime preinstalled.

**Instructions for Use:**

1. Download the [latest release here](https://github.com/schnalz-digital/deathmanager/releases/latest) on GitHub.
2. Extract the contents of the provided `.zip` file, which includes two files, into your DOOM folder.
3. Execute the `.exe` file to start the Launcher.
4. At the top of the Launcher, specify your preferred DOOM Source Port (Zandronum or GZDOOM).
5. Click on the `+` icon next to `Game WAD` and designate the path to your `.wad` files. Addons in `.IWAD, .PWAD, .PK3, or .DEH` format within the `WAD` folder will be automatically detected.
6. Choose a map and press `Go!` to frag demons.

**Note:** The `.exe` file requires the `resources.neu` file as a dependency to function properly.
