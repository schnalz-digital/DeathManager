# DOOM I + II Launcher â€“ MS-DOS Style

Relive the nostalgia of 1993 with this classic DOOM I + II Launcher, designed to emulate the authentic MS-DOS experience.

**Instructions for Use:**

1. Download the [latest release here](https://github.com/schnalz-digital/deathmanager/releases/latest) on GitHub.
2. Extract the contents of the provided `.zip` file, which includes two files, into your DOOM folder.
3. Execute the `.exe` file to start the Launcher.
4. At the top of the Launcher, specify your preferred DOOM Source Port (Zandronum or GZDOOM).
5. Click on the `+` icon next to `Game WAD` and designate the path to your `.wad` file. Any addon WADs in `IWAD, PWAD, PK3, or DEH` format will be automatically detected within the `.wad` folder.
Choose a map and press `Go!` to initiate gameplay.

**Note:** The `.exe` file requires the `resources.neu` file as a dependency to function properly.
